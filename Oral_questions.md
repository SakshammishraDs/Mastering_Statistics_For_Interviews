# A. Introduction to Statistics

## 1. Levels of measurement: Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, Ratio

Got it! Here’s a more conversational and natural version of the answer:

---

**Interviewer:** Can you explain the levels of measurement?  
**Candidate:**  
Sure! There are four levels: **nominal**, **ordinal**, **interval**, and **ratio**.  

- **Nominal** is just categories, like colors or types of cars—no order or ranking.  
- **Ordinal** adds order, like rankings (1st, 2nd, 3rd), but you can’t say how much better 1st is than 2nd.  
- **Interval** has meaningful differences, like temperature in Celsius, but no true zero.  
- **Ratio** has meaningful differences *and* a true zero, like weight or height—so you can say something is twice as heavy or tall.
